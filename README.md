#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/uFBeF-o2Q3w>
#### Description:
This is my final project for CS50. Limited by programming languages I made this simple website.
AnonymousMe is a platform that lets users share their thoughts about other users to them anonymously. User has to register their account or login if already has an account.
User can  go to other user's profile by clicking on their name on right side list below "People you may know". User can send message with fake money as a gift (buy me a candy) to other users.
User can easily see whom they sent message, gift and total amount spend in "Sent". Users can see a new message in "Notification", "home" and "profile". User can see when and how much gifts
they recieved with total amount in "gift". Lastly User can delete their account in "Settings".
